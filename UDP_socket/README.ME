Write a client, UDP proxy and server by UDP socket. The server listens to the packets, and the socket client send “Hello” to the server. When the socket server receive a “Hello”, it returns a “World” back. During the transmission, UDP proxy directly forwards packets from the client to the server, after receiving the packets. Please add indicator “i” along with Hello to show the i-th transmission, and i is from 1 to 10000.
For example:
The client sends Hello 1 to the server.
The server sends World 1 to the client after it receives Hello 1.
The client sends Hello 2 to the server after it receives World 1.
… This process repeats till the server sends World 10000 to the client.
